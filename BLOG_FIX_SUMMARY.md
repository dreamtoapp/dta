# Blog Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem
The blog post pages were loading successfully (HTTP 200), but displayed a **404 error for the featured image** because the seed data used a placeholder Cloudinary URL that doesn't exist:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1234567890/nextjs-hero.jpg
```

## Solution
1. Updated `prisma/seed-blog.ts` to set `featuredImage: null` instead of using invalid URLs
2. Created `prisma/reseed-blog.ts` script to clear and reseed data
3. Reseeded the database with corrected data

## Result
✅ Blog posts now load without image 404 errors  
✅ Fallback emoji icon (📝) displays when no featured image  
✅ All 3 sample posts working correctly

## Test URLs
- **Arabic Blog**: http://localhost:3000/ar/blog
- **English Blog**: http://localhost:3000/en/blog
- **Sample Post**: http://localhost:3000/ar/blog/دليل-nextjs-15-الشامل

## Adding Real Images Later
When you want to add featured images to blog posts:
1. Upload images to your Cloudinary account
2. Update the `featuredImage` field in the database with the real Cloudinary URL
3. Or add images via admin dashboard (when implemented)

The blog system gracefully handles posts with or without images!
